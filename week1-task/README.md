# ICP-5L7MKJ-2026-REPO

# # Overview
This repository contains my Tasks and projects for my Internship at InternCareerPath.
# # Week One : Host a static website with CDN
I hosted a static website called Law Bricks on Amazon Web Services. I made use of cloud stacks like Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Codepipeline.

# # CLOUD STACKS
Amazon S3 acts as the storage that stores the HTML/CSS files. Here I created a bucket called Law-bricks-site and uploaded my files into it.
AWS Cloudfront (CDN) ensures the website loads fast for users anywhere in the world by using edge locations.
AWS Codepipeline as as bridge between Amazon s3 and github. It detects changes in github and deploy them to s3.
